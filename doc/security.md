# Security Overview (Current State)

## Introduction
Pennyworth is designed to use Amazon Cognito and REST API endpoints for authentication and authorization. The current implementation is in early stages, with most security features planned but not yet implemented.

---

## 1. Current Implementation

### Authentication Model
- Basic Cognito User Pool setup in `template.yaml`
- JWT validation framework in `auth.py` (not fully implemented)
- API key authentication stubs (not implemented)

### Authorization Model
- Basic Cognito group structure defined (admin, user)
- IAM role templates in `template.yaml`
- No actual authorization checks implemented

### Transport Security
- HTTPS configuration in API Gateway (via `template.yaml`)
- No HTTP fallback permitted

### Secrets Management
- No secrets in code
- Environment variables used for configuration
- All project-specific environment variables prefixed with `PENNYWORTH_`

---

## 2. Planned Security Features

### Authentication
- [ ] Complete JWT validation implementation
- [ ] API key management via Cognito custom attributes
- [ ] MFA support for admin users
- [ ] Secure API key generation and storage
- [ ] API key rotation mechanism

### Authorization
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Complete least-privilege IAM implementation
- [ ] Group-based permission system
- [ ] API key permission scoping

### User Management
- [ ] Secure user creation workflow
- [ ] Password policy enforcement
- [ ] User status management
- [ ] Account lockout mechanism

### API Key Management
- [ ] Secure key generation
- [ ] Key rotation workflow
- [ ] Key revocation mechanism
- [ ] Usage tracking and limits

### Audit and Monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive logging implementation
- [ ] X-Ray tracing setup
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- [ ] Security event monitoring

## 4. Security Best Practices

### Current
- No secrets in code
- HTTPS everywhere
- Environment variable configuration
- Basic Cognito setup

### Recommended
- Implement MFA for admin users
- Regular security audits
- Automated security testing
- Regular dependency updates
- Security monitoring and alerting

---

## 5. Security Considerations for Development

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete JWT validation implementation
2. Implement API key management
3. Set up proper authorization checks
4. Implement secure user management
5. Add comprehensive logging

### Ongoing Tasks
1. Regular security reviews
2. Dependency updates
3. Security testing
4. Documentation updates
